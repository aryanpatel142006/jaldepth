# 💧 JalDepth — how deep is the water on this street?

A small, self-contained computer-vision demo: give it a photo, a short video, or your **live camera** pointed at a flooded street and it tells you **where the water is**, **who and what is standing in it**, and **how deep it is** as a class a driver understands — **Dry · Ankle · Knee · Wheel**.

It is the vision module of **JalDrishti**, our Smart India Hackathon 2026 project (PS SIH26085, *Urban Flood Nowcasting System — Drainage and Rainfall Coupling*), packaged on its own so it can be shown and tried in one click.

**Run it:** locally in one command (below), or deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud in three clicks (see Deploy). Vercel cannot host PyTorch/OpenCV inference.

## What it does

| Step | How | Trained by us? |
|---|---|---|
| **Find the water** | Two stages. **Stage 1:** YOLOv8n-seg **fine-tuned on ATLANTIS** (Erfani et al. 2022 — 5,195 Creative-Commons photos of waterbodies, 56 labels; we merged its 17 water labels into one *water* class). 3,364 train / 535 val / 1,296 test images, 20 epochs, 512 px. **Test mask mAP50 0.58 · mAP50-95 0.38.** **Stage 3 (South Asia):** we assembled our own set of ~1,900 freely licensed flood photos from Wikimedia Commons (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka), labelled water with an ensemble teacher (our two models + an ADE20K scene model, 2-of-3 agreement, 956 kept) and fine-tuned again: held-out South-Asian val mask mAP50 **0.78 → 0.82**, ATLANTIS test unchanged (0.58); water found in 37 of 38 Indian sample photos (was 34). **Stage 2 (Indian adaptation):** self-training — the stage-1 model pseudo-labels 27 Indian street photos and Mumbai-2017 video frames (high confidence, cleaned), which are added ×4 to the training set for 8 more epochs. ATLANTIS test score unchanged (0.58); on the Indian photos it recovers muddy brown water the first model missed (e.g. Gujarat street 2% → 45%) but misses one scene the first model caught, so the app runs stage 2 first and falls back to stage 1 when it finds under 3% water. | **Yes** |
| **Find people & vehicles** | Pretrained YOLOv8n (COCO). A box whose base sits inside the water mask is *standing in water*. | No (pretrained) |
| **Learned depth classifier** | YOLOv8n-cls fine-tuned on ~300 flood photos we labelled by eye (Dry/Ankle/Knee/Wheel), from a dataset we assembled ourselves from Wikimedia Commons (India: 501 photos; plus Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka). Used when no reference object is in view. Held-out: 76% top-1, 97% within one class; the full estimator on those 59 held-out photos: **68% exact, 90% within one class** (was 24% / 53% before). | **Yes** |
| **Depth — always estimated** | Most trusted first: **ruler** you mark (kerb ≈ 15 cm, pole bands, wall) → exact cm; **known-size objects standing in water** (person 170 cm, car 150 cm, motorcycle 110 cm, hydrant 75 cm…): expected height − visible height, scale taken from the object's width, weighted by size and confidence; **learned classifier** when nothing is in view; a conservative surface-water estimate only if the classifier is unsure. Every result states its method and confidence. | Geometry |
| **Two scenes** | *Real street / CCTV* (India) and *Table-top rig*: a tray with tinted water and a toy car — all size references are scaled to the toy car you enter, so a 7 cm car behaves like a 4.5 m car and the ruler height is entered in real centimetres (a 3 cm block = 15 cm kerb). Verified: a synthetic rig frame with 45 cm true depth reads 44.5 cm with the ruler. | Geometry |
| **Flags** | *Person standing in water* · *Vehicle in wheel-deep water* | Rules |

**Indian test set and honest accuracy.** 38 freely licensed photos of flooded streets in Mumbai, Chennai, Vadodara, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru from Wikimedia Commons (`samples/`, credits in `samples/ATTRIBUTION.md`) plus a 2017 Mumbai flood video. The model finds water in 34 of the 38 photos (mean coverage 35%) and flags people and vehicles in water correctly on the Mumbai and Chennai scenes. There is no public street-level *Indian* flood segmentation dataset yet — the open Indian sets are satellite imagery — so we train on the global ATLANTIS set, adapt to Indian footage by self-training, and validate on Indian streets.

We labelled the 38 Indian photos by eye with a depth class and rough centimetres (`samples/depth_labels.json` — judgement, not measurement) and scored the estimator (`models/depth_eval_indian.json`): **exact class 39%, within one class 82%, mean error 27 cm.** The split matters: when a person or vehicle is standing in the water the error is ~11–14 cm (usually the right class); when nothing is in view the estimate is a conservative "surface water, likely under 10 cm" and it is wrong on deep scenes (boats, canals, lakes). That is deliberate: a plain camera image cannot tell how deep an empty sheet of water is, and a CCTV feed must not cry "knee-deep" over a wet road. For real readings mark a kerb or wait for a person or vehicle to enter the frame — which on a junction camera happens constantly.

No open Indian CCTV flood image set exists; the Wikimedia photos are the closest licensed substitute, and the app is built to be tested on your own CCTV frames (upload a photo or video).

## Our demo tray (kerb + toy car, no ruler) — the school / SIH rig

Sidebar → Scene → **Demo tray — kerb + toy car**. The striped foam kerb stands for a real 15 cm kerb and the toy tyre for 60 cm, exactly as in the build guide. Calibrate once with two sliders (drag the green lines onto the road/floor and the top of the kerb), pick the x-range of wall/kerb where the waterline is visible, and add a few drops of **blue food colouring** to the water. The app reads the waterline on the wall, converts it to real-world centimetres via the kerb, and reports the class with the action from the guide: **Dry** (kerb visible) · **Ankle** (< 15 cm, kerb partly covered · pre-alert) · **Knee** (15–60 cm, tyre partly submerged · alert, deploy pump) · **Wheel** (> 60 cm, tyre fully submerged · close road). Untinted water: choose *Compare with empty-box reference*, capture the empty box once, then pour. Use **Live camera — continuous** on the laptop for the stage.

## Glass-tank demo (side view, no ruler needed)

Point the camera through the glass at a tank with a road bed and a die-cast car. Choose **Glass tank — side view** and enter two numbers: the model car's length (≈24 cm for a 1:18 Golf) and the real car's length (430 cm). The car is the ruler: its detected length gives pixels-per-centimetre and its tyres define the floor; the water surface is found as a long horizontal edge (segmentation mask + edge detector). You get depth in the tank to the pixel, the real-world equivalent at that scale, the class, and how much of the car is under water. If the car is briefly hidden, the last good calibration is kept; a manual two-line fallback exists but is not needed. Verified on synthetic tank frames: 0.0 cm error at 3, 6.5, 10 and 14 cm.

## Live camera

Two modes in the sidebar: **Live camera — snapshot** uses the browser camera (laptop or phone) and analyses one picture at a time; **Live camera — continuous** streams the webcam through WebRTC and draws the water mask, boxes and depth class on every frame (the ruler sliders apply live). Continuous mode is smooth on a laptop; on a hosted server the video is relayed through the browser and may lag.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

First run downloads nothing: both models are in `models/` (≈13 MB). CPU is enough (~0.1 s per image on a laptop).

## Deploy (free)

**Streamlit Community Cloud** (recommended — runs Python + OpenCV + PyTorch):
1. Push this folder to GitHub (public repo).
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io → *New app* → pick the repo, branch `main`, file `app.py` → Deploy.
3. Done; the URL is `https://<app-name>.streamlit.app`. `requirements.txt` is already set up (no apt packages needed: OpenCV headless wheel).

Vercel is not suitable for this app: its serverless functions cannot run PyTorch/OpenCV inference within their size and time limits.
